------------------

- integration of imio.patterns made by Aurore 
(affinitic & boulch) during the january 2020 sprint. 
The actual imio.patterns (https://github.com/IMIO/imio.patterns) 
just adds a slider (using https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) 
and was made to test functionnalities before the integration. 
It's been merged and so is this release.
